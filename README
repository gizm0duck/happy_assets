HappyAssets
===========

Asset packing that allows you to group files together to form different packages for various uses, such as a 
javascript package for admin sections and customer facing, or maybe a group that is only used in a particular 
controller.

The package contains to rake tasks that allow you to pack and unpack the javascripts on the fly, so you can push out 
js or css fixes and package them up without having to bring down the server.  Also, you can unpack the code in production
for debugging purposes, all without having to push any code changes or bring down the site.

Example
=======

  To create an initial config file from the files you currently have in your public directory run:
  >> rake happy_assets:initialize

  You can have an indefinite number of packages within each section (js or css).  A sample config file is below:

  ** SAMPLE **
  css:
    default:
    - base.css
    - ie_fixes.css
  
    admin:
    - admin.css
    - admin_ie_fixes.css

  js: 
    jquery: 
    - jquery-1.2.6.js
    - jquery_no_conflict.js
    - jquery_compat.js
    - jquery_dimensions.js
  
    default:
    - foo.js
    - boo.js
    - zoo.js



  To create the packaged files outlined in config/happy_assets.yml run:
  >> rake happy_assets:pack

  To remove the packaged version and return to loading the files individually run:
  >> rake happy_assets:unpack

  Usage Information

    In your layout file there are 2 helpers to utilize the packages.  One is for js, and the other is for css, but 
    their usage is the exact same.

    <%= packaged_javascript_include :jquery, :default %>

      When you have not created the packages will render:
        <script src="/javascripts/jquery-1.2.6.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/jquery_no_conflict.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/jquery_compat.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/jquery_dimensions.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/foo.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/boo.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/zoo.js?1240106575" type="text/javascript"></script>

      When you have created the packed files will render
        <script src="/javascripts/packaged_jquery.js?1240177021" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/javascripts/packaged_default.js?1240177021" type="text/javascript"></script>
      
      
    The css equivelant is:
      <%= packaged_stylesheet_include :default, :admin %>
